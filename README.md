## Contributing
I am still learning JS. I obtained the code from Leon Chen (https://transcranial.github.io/keras-js) and modified it after facing a deluge of difficulties (I am just starting npm, webpack, Vuetify, JS, CSS etc). It was a headache to iron out errors but a good headache to learn, modify and use the code in 2 days.

1. Download/clone, open in Webstorm.
2. Open with webstorm, let it get the required npm packages automatically. Or install them manually.
3. Make changes to vue files, or js files in project/src folder.
4. Using Webstorm, goto Tools>Run Gulp/Grunt/npm task. Or run the command manually.
5. In webstorm, run the index.html file and changes should be visible in the browser.
